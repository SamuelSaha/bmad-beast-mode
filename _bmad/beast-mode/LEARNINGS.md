# 🧠 SYSTEM LEARNINGS & EVOLUTION LOG
*Agents MUST read this file before starting complex tasks.*

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS (Things we learned NOT to do)
- [2024-01-10] Do not use `layout.tsx` for page transitions; use `template.tsx` instead. (Context: Next.js 15 App Router).
- [2024-01-11] Do not use pure black (#000000); use Obsidian (#020204) for the Midnight Luxe theme.

## ✅ ESTABLISHED PATTERNS (Things that worked well)
- Fuse.js is the standard for client-side search.
- Command Palette requires `Radix UI Dialog` for accessibility.
