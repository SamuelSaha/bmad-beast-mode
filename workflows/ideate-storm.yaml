description: "Rapidly generate 20+ concepts, ruthlessly filter to top 3 viable winners."
estimated_time: "15-30 minutes"

trigger_conditions:
  - Need to name a product/feature/variable
  - Stuck on a hard problem
  - Exploring solution space before committing
  - Quarterly roadmap planning
  - Innovation sprint

agents:
  primary: brainstormer
  support:
    - pm
    - ux-designer

phases:
  - phase: Explosion (Divergent)
    agent: brainstormer
    command: "*brainstorm context: '{problem_statement}' quantity: 20"
    artifact: "docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-raw.md"
    required: true
    rules:
      - No judging - Wild ideas allowed
      - Generate 20+ distinct concepts minimum
      - Mix low-effort/high-impact, moonshots, pragmatic fixes
      - Variety over quality at this stage
    tasks:
      - Generate concepts rapidly
      - Don't self-censor
      - Think from multiple perspectives
      - Include obvious AND non-obvious ideas
    gates:
      - 20+ concepts generated
      - Diverse range (tactical to strategic)
      - No concept longer than 2 sentences

  - phase: Filter (Convergent)
    agent: pm
    command: "*filter-concepts source: 'docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-raw.md' criteria: 'feasibility,impact,excitement'"
    artifact: "docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-filtered.md"
    required: true
    criteria:
      - Feasibility: Can we build this in <2 weeks?
      - Impact: Does this actually move the needle?
      - Excitement: Is this boring? (If yes, kill it)
    tasks:
      - Eliminate bottom 85% (17 out of 20)
      - Be ruthless - "good" is the enemy of "great"
      - Document why each was eliminated
    gates:
      - Exactly 3 finalists remain
      - Elimination rationale documented
      - All 3 meet feasibility threshold

  - phase: Winners (Deep Dive)
    agent: pm
    command: "*detail-concepts source: 'docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-filtered.md'"
    artifact: "docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-winners.md"
    required: true
    output_per_concept:
      - Concept Name: [Catchy title]
      - The Hook: [Why users care immediately]
      - Secret Sauce: [Unique advantage/unfair edge]
      - Execution Rating: 
          - Difficulty: [1-10]
          - Impact: [1-10]
      - Next Step: [What to do if we pick this]
    gates:
      - All 3 winners fully detailed
      - Hook is compelling (not generic)
      - Secret sauce is defensible
      - Next step is actionable

  - phase: Recommendation (Optional)
    agent: pm
    command: "*recommend-winner source: 'docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-winners.md'"
    artifact: "docs/bmad/{slug}/ideation-recommendation.md"
    required: false
    tasks:
      - Rank the 3 winners
      - Provide reasoning for #1 choice
      - Define success metrics
      - Outline MVP scope
    gates:
      - Clear #1 pick identified
      - Reasoning is data-driven
      - MVP is achievable

output_format:
  raw_concepts:
    - Numbered list of 20+ ideas
    - 1-2 sentences each
  
  finalists:
    - 3 detailed concepts
    - Execution ratings
    - Elimination rationale for others
  
  recommendation:
    - Ranked finalists (#1, #2, #3)
    - Decision framework used
    - Next steps

quality_gates:
  blocking:
    - Must generate 20+ ideas (quantity matters)
    - Must eliminate to exactly 3 (not 4, not 5)
    - Winners must have Hook + Secret Sauce defined
  
  warning:
    - If all 3 finalists are low-impact (<5/10)
    - If all 3 finalists are high-difficulty (>8/10)

stop_rules:
  - If no concepts meet feasibility bar, revisit problem statement
  - If stakeholders can't agree, use PM to arbitrate based on data
