phases:
  # === PHASE 1: EMPATHIZE ===
  - phase: Empathize
    description: "Understand the user problem deeply"
    agent: analyst
    command: "*analyze-problem"
    instruction: |
      Before ideation, deeply understand:
      1. WHO is the user? (Persona)
      2. WHAT is their pain? (Problem statement)
      3. WHY does this matter? (Impact)
      4. WHEN/WHERE does this happen? (Context)
      
      Output a User Problem Statement in this format:
      "[User] needs a way to [need] because [insight]."

    required: true

  # === PHASE 2: DIVERGE ===
  - phase: Diverge
    description: "Generate many ideas without judgment"
    agent: value-advocate
    command: "*brainstorm"
    instruction: |
      Generate 10+ divergent ideas to solve the user problem.
      
      Use these ideation techniques:
      
      **SCAMPER:**
      - Substitute: What can we replace?
      - Combine: What can we merge?
      - Adapt: What can we borrow from elsewhere?
      - Modify: What can we change?
      - Put to other use: What else could use this?
      - Eliminate: What can we remove?
      - Reverse: What if we did the opposite?
      
      **Rules:**
      - Quantity over quality (defer judgment)
      - Build on others' ideas
      - Encourage wild ideas
      - Stay visual (describe the experience)
      
      Output: Numbered list of 10+ ideas with brief descriptions.

    required: true

  # === PHASE 3: CONVERGE ===
  - phase: Converge
    description: "Filter and prioritize ideas"
    agent: pm
    command: "*prioritize"
    instruction: |
      Evaluate each idea against:
      
      **Feasibility (1-5):**
      - Technical complexity
      - Resource requirements
      - Time to implement
      
      **Business Value (1-5):**
      - Revenue potential
      - User impact
      - Strategic alignment
      
      **Differentiation (1-5):**
      - Competitive advantage
      - Uniqueness
      - Defensibility
      
      Create a 2x2 matrix (Feasibility vs Value).
      Select TOP 3 ideas for refinement.

  # === PHASE 4: PROTOTYPE (CONCEPTUAL) ===
  - phase: Prototype
    description: "Sketch the winning concept"
    agent: ux
    command: "*define-ux"
    instruction: |
      For the TOP idea, create:
      
      1. **User Journey Map** (3-5 steps)
         - Entry point
         - Key interactions
         - Success moment
      
      2. **Lo-Fi Wireframe Description**
         - Screen 1: What does user see?
         - Screen 2: What do they do?
         - Screen 3: What's the result?
      
      3. **Key Differentiator**
         - What makes this unique?
         - The "Aha!" moment

    required: true

  # === PHASE 5: VALIDATE ===
  - phase: Validate
    description: "Sanity check before commitment"
    agent: analyst
    command: "*validate-concept"
    instruction: |
      Before proceeding to full planning:
      
      **Technical Feasibility:**
      - [ ] Can we build this with current stack?
      - [ ] Any new dependencies required?
      - [ ] Estimated complexity (S/M/L)?
      
      **Market Fit:**
      - [ ] Does this solve a real problem?
      - [ ] Would users pay/engage for this?
      - [ ] How do we measure success?
      
      **Risk Assessment:**
      - What could go wrong?
      - What do we not know?
      - What needs research first?
      
      **Go/No-Go Decision:**
      - PROCEED to Standard Feature Flow
      - PIVOT (refine idea)
      - KILL (not viable)

  # === PHASE 6: BRIEF ===
  - phase: Brief
    description: "Create the Product Brief"
    agent: pm
    command: "*create-brief"
    instruction: |
