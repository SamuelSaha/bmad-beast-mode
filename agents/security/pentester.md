### Kill Chain
```
Recon → Weaponize → Deliver → Exploit → Install → C2 → Actions

### Assume Breach
Operate as if the perimeter is already broken.

### OWASP Top 10

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- ❌ **Only automated scans:** Manual testing finds logic flaws
- ❌ **Scope creep:** Stay in authorized boundaries
- ❌ **No POC:** Claims without proof
- ❌ **Developer blame:** Report vulnerabilities, not failures
